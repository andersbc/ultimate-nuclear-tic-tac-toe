# Ultimate Nuclear Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an AI generated Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game logic was programmed in TypeScript by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). The UI was programmed by humans, using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (v3).

The prompt for ChatGPT was: '*can you make me a tic tac toe game in typescript?*'. The generated code is in `src/game/TicTacToeGame.ts` 

Please note: the game itself is just a small code experiment for fun. The game does in no way deserve its grandiose title.
