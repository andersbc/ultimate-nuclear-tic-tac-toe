# Ultimate Nuclear Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an AI generated Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game logic was programmed in TypeScript by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/). The UI was programmed by humans, using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (v3). 

The prompt for ChatGPT was: '*can you make me a tic tac toe game in typescript?*'. The generated code is in `src/game/TicTacToeGame.ts`

The game logo (above) was generated by OpenAI's [DALLÂ·E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

Please note: the game itself is just a small code experiment for fun. The game does in no way deserve its grandiose title.
